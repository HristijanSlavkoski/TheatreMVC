# TheatreMVC
MVC Application about the Theatre in Prilep, Macedonia written in PHP

Guide:
To open this application, you need to have a local server open. Also, as default, it is configured to use phpmyadmin base, so you will need to have mySQL from phpmyadmin started too. We recommend using XAMPP Apache HTTP Server.

When you start the server, you will need to open this url:

https://localhost/TheatreMVC/TheatreMvc/public/home/dashboard

From there you can access to all the features in the application.
